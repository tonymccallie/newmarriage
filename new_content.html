APP COPY

DASHBOARD:
-Greetings from Steve and Rajan Trafton, the "5 Days to a New Marriage" host couple.  Steve and Rajan have dedicated their lives to seeing marriages transformed by the concepts within this online application.  Menu options include: information about marriage intensives, personalized therapist referrals, products, resources for increased insight, and content that works to reshape individuals and marriages. 

INTRODUCTION:
For many couples the idea of an improved marriage seems too far out of reach to even take the first step.  The reality is that with joint dedication, individual introspection, and bold courage a new marriage could be 5 days away. As you begin using this App, you will probably fit into one of two groups: you have attended a Marriage Intensive at one of the Hideaway Experience locations across the country or you have gone through the "5 Days to a New Marriage" resource (individually or in a Small Group). If you do not fit into either of those groups, we are excited to have you join us as we all work to grow our marriage as we work through this resource. To get a deeper understanding of what is taught in this App, we would suggest that you first read through the "5 Days to a New Marriage" book. The following content begins the road towards a new marriage.

DAY 1:
-The first step towards a new marriage means individuals must first grasp the pain from the past.  Pain from significant life experiences results in attempts to cope with that pain.  This coping often results in more pain, beginning what is known as the Pain Cycle.  The following exercise targets how to clearly identify pain from the past and the coping behaviors associated.  

DAY 2:
-Take heart.  There is more to the story than simply the Pain Cycle.  While it is imperative to understand the Pain Cycle and its roots, it is equally important to become who we were intended to become, new creations living amidst truth.  The following exercise works to identify truth and healthy, life-giving actions rather than negative coping.  This cycles is known as the Peace Cycle.  Use the exercise below and allow truth to heal pain and create your individual Peace Cycle.  

DAY 3: 
-The insight gained from the Pain and Peace Cycles are the keys to unlocking a new marriage.  But, like many things in this life, the work comes from making the new marriage a habit.  Spoken outloud and repeated for a minimum of 90 days, the Four Steps work to change brain chemistry from old thought patterns (pain) to new ones (peace).  

DAY 4:
-The two have become one flesh.  What does that really mean?  It means USNESS, a unification of two individuals becoming vessels as the testing ground to become like Christ.  As an US, problem solving looks new and improved.  While holding on to the Pain Cycle, Peace Cycle, and Four Steps venture forward to approach problem solving in a new way.

DAY 5/CORE VALUES:
-Now that the roots to a new marriage have been planted, it is time to cast vision.  Vision for the future.  Vision for your marriage.  Vision guided by self-care.  New marriages require individuals to cultivate healthy mental, physical, emotional, and spiritual habits.  The way towards this health is known as Self-Care.  Use the tools below to foster intentional Self-Care for you and your marriage.

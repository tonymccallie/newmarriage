				<p>Greetings from Steve and Rajan Trafton, the "5 Days to a New Marriage" host couple.  Steve and Rajan have dedicated their lives to seeing marriages transformed by the concepts within this online application.  Menu options include: information about marriage intensives, personalized therapist referrals, products, resources for increased insight, and content that works to reshape individuals and marriages. </p>
				<p>For many couples the idea of an improved marriage seems too far out of reach to even take the first step.  The reality is that with joint dedication, individual introspection, and bold courage a new marriage could be 5 days away. As you begin using this App, you will probably fit into one of two groups: you have attended a Marriage Intensive at one of the Hideaway Experience locations across the country or you have gone through the “5 Days to a New Marriage” resource (individually or in a Small Group). If you do not fit into either of those groups, we are excited to have you join us as we all work to grow our marriage as we work through this resource. To get a deeper understanding of what is taught in this App, we would suggest that you first read through the <a onclick="window.open('https://5daystoanewmarriage.com/product','_sytem'); return false;" href="#">“5 Days to a New Marriage” book</a>. The following content begins the road towards a new marriage.</p>
